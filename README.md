# Forecasting Financial Inclusion in Ethiopia

## Project Overview
This project develops a transparent, policy-oriented forecasting system to analyze and project Ethiopia’s financial inclusion trajectory using the World Bank Global Findex framework.

The analysis focuses on two core dimensions:
- **Access** — Account Ownership Rate
- **Usage** — Digital Payment Adoption Rate

Given limited historical survey data, the project emphasizes event-based reasoning, scenario analysis, and explicit treatment of uncertainty rather than complex machine learning models.

## Business Context
Ethiopia is undergoing rapid digital financial transformation driven by:
- Expansion of mobile money platforms (Telebirr, M-Pesa)
- Market liberalization and new entrants
- National digital infrastructure initiatives

Despite these developments, financial inclusion growth has slowed, raising important policy questions that this project aims to explore.

## Project Objectives
1. Understand and enrich financial inclusion data for Ethiopia
2. Analyze historical patterns and structural gaps
3. Model the impact of major events and policy interventions
4. Forecast financial inclusion outcomes for 2025–2027
5. Communicate insights through an interactive dashboard

## Data
- **Primary Dataset:** `ethiopia_fi_unified_data.csv`
- **Reference Codes:** `reference_codes.csv`
- Data follows a unified schema supporting observations, events, and modeled impact links.

Additional data sources are documented in `data_enrichment_log.md`.

## Methodology Overview
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sparse time-series data
- Event impact modeling using lagged, additive effects
- Trend-based and scenario-driven forecasting
- Explicit uncertainty representation via confidence ranges
- Interactive visualization using Streamlit

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` — Task-based analysis notebooks
- `src/` — Reusable data processing and modeling logic
- `dashboard/` — Interactive Streamlit application
- `reports/` — Figures and written summaries

## Dashboard
To run the dashboard locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
